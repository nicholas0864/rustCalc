1. **Decide on the Token Representation:**
   - Choose whether you want to represent the square root as a single character (like “√”) or as a word (“sqrt”).
   - This decision affects how you update your tokenization.

2. **Update the Tokenization Function (`tokenize`):**
   - **Allowed Characters:** Add your chosen square root representation to the allowed characters set.
   - **Token Grouping:** Ensure that when the tokenizer encounters the square root symbol or letters (if using “sqrt”), it creates a distinct token.

3. **Adjust the Precedence Function (`precedence`):**
   - Add a new match arm for the square root token.
   - Assign it a high precedence value (higher than the binary operators) so it’s applied first during the conversion to RPN.

4. **Modify the RPN Conversion Function (`rpn`):**
   - Make sure your shunting-yard algorithm logic can handle the square root token correctly.
   - Because square root is a unary operator, you might treat it slightly differently (i.e., not expecting two operands when it reaches evaluation).

5. **Update the Evaluation Function (`eval_pn`):**
   - In the evaluation loop, detect when the token is your square root operator.
   - Instead of popping two operands (like you do for binary operators), only pop one operand.
   - Compute the square root of that operand and push the result back onto the evaluation stack.
   - Consider error checking (e.g., rejecting negative inputs if you don’t want to allow complex numbers).

6. **Test Your Changes:**
   - Run several test expressions involving the square root operator.
   - For example, expressions like “√(9)” or “√9 + 16 / 4” to verify that the conversion to RPN and subsequent evaluation work as expected.
